	I do lots of programming in my job but also do it as a hobby. I have a 
	particular interest in game development and procedural 
	generation/programmatically generated art. I am an amateur potter and 
	mainly make slab-built geometric pots. I also collect fossils.

	Here are some of my hobby programming projects. Some have source 
	available on <a href="https://gitlab.com/jmahon">GitLab</a> or 
	<a href="https://github.com/joemahon89/">GitHub</a>, but 
	if not its likely because the code is a bit messy. If you 
	are interested in something where the source isn't public let me 
	know and I can likely neaten it up enough to share!

# Ceramics content
ceramics_content_blocks = [
	'''
	I have been doing ceramics/pottery for a few years. I started with an 
	evening class once a week, but now just do my own thing and take my pieces 
	to a local studio for firing. I am still a definite amateur and mostly make 
	things up as I go along.
	''',
	'''
	I really like geometric, angular forms and so this is what I make the 
	most of. These are made using clay which has been wedged (kneaded to 
	remove the air) and rolled out to the desired thickness. Shapes can then 
	be cut out and joined together by scoring the edge of the clay and 
	applying wet clay (a bit like glue). The angles required for this can 
	be a bit tricky so I wrote a Blender script so I could easily create 
	designs and made an adjustable mitre cutter to cut any angle.

	I enjoy looking for fossils. The most productive area somewhat close to 
	me is the East/North Yorkshire coast. Some locations on this coastline 
	are productive for Jurassic fossils like 
	<a href="#ammonites">ammonites</a>, <a href="#belemnites">belemnites</a> 
	(squid-like creatures) and <a href="#bivalves">bivalves</a> (shells). 
	You can also find marine reptile remains (although I have yet to find 
	any!) and <a href="#jet">Whitby jet</a>. Here are some of my favourite 
	fossils that I have collected &#129460;
