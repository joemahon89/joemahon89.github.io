	I do lots of programming in my job but also do it as a hobby. I have a 
	particular interest in game development and procedural 
	generation/programmatically generated art. I am an amateur potter and 
	mainly make slab-built geometric pots. I also collect 
	<a href="testlink">fossils</a>.

	Here are some of my hobby programming projects. Some have source

	<a href="https://github.com/joemahon89/">GitHub</a>, but 
	if not its likely because the code is a bit messy. If you 
	are interested in something where the source isn't public let me 
	know and I can likely neaten it up enough to share!

	I enjoy looking for fossils. The most productive area somewhat close to 
	me is the East/North Yorkshire coast. Some locations on this coastline 
	are productive for Jurassic fossils like 
	<a href="#ammonites">ammonites</a>, <a href="#belemnites">belemnites</a> 
	(squid-like creatures) and <a href="#bivalves">bivalves</a> (shells). 
	You can also find marine reptile remains (although I have yet to find

	fossils that I have collected &#129460;
