	<h2 id="procbirds">"Procedural Birds" Twitter bot</h2> 
	I am interested in procedural generation and generative art, where 
	images are created using systems and rules defined in code. I wrote 
	a program which generates simple, stylised images of birds. Each image 
	is created from scratch and is completely unique. Every line, angle, 
	colour is decided using randomness within defined limits. 
	''',
	'''
	The birds are built line by line, starting at the right-most foot, 
	drawing the neck length and angle based on the reasonable 
	approximations of the possible angles that a bird's neck may have. 
	The head is a random percentage of a full circle between two limits.
	The beak can attach at numerous points on the head and have variable 
	thicknesses and colours. The angle of the back varies, and can result 
	birds ranging in appearance from from a long-necked goose-like bird to 
	stumpy quails. The tail angle, thickness, colour, number of feathers 
	is all computed and drawn. The leg length and angle is chosen based on 
	the approximate center of gravity of the bird, so that it doesn't look 
	like it will topple over! The colours are chosen from colour schemes 
	defined in code, and there is a probability that the bird may have 
	different coloured wings or tail or both.
	''',
	'''
	The program also generates names for the birds based on their features.
	For example, a bird where the tail has been drawn with short lines may 
	have the prefix 'short-tailed' or 'stub-tailed'. Birds with larger angles 
	between the lines on their back may have the prefix 'hump-backed'. The 
	colours are also used as descriptors, with ornithological sounding 
	additions, e.g. 'golden-tailed', 'candy winged', 'bronze-feathered'.
	''',
	'''
	I stuck the program onto a Raspberry Pi and wrote a small Twitter bot 
	which generates a new bird every hour, names it based on its features 
	and posts the image on Twitter.

	moving lava, gravitational anomalies and falling rocks. The game is free

	This is the second Android game that I published. It is a family-friendly 
	puzzle game, where the aim of the game is to move your chickens into their 
	coops using a limited number of moves (and without getting eaten by 
	foxes!). Levels can be completed in 4, 5 or 6 moves depending on 
	difficulty. There are 60 levels and there is only a single solution to 
	each level which adds to the challenge. The game is free and there are no 
	ads or in-app-purchases.

# Ceramics content

	'''
	I have been doing ceramics/pottery for a few years. I started with an 
	evening class once a week, but now just do my own thing and take my pieces 
	to a local studio for firing. I am still a definite amateur and mostly 
	make things up as I go along.
	''',
	'''
	I really like geometric, angular forms and so this is what I make the 
	most of. These are made using clay which has been wedged (kneaded to 
	remove the air) and rolled out to the desired thickness. Shapes can then 
	be cut out and joined together by scoring the edge of the clay and 
	applying wet clay (a bit like glue). The angles required for this can 
	be a bit tricky so I wrote a Blender script so I could easily create 
	designs and made an adjustable mitre cutter to cut any angle.
